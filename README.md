# GoType
A modern typeracer clone.  
Built on [GoTemplate](https://github.com/UberBosser/GoTemplate)  
Uses [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) and [Gorilla websockets](https://github.com/gorilla/websocket) as the back end and [Infernojs](https://github.com/infernojs/inferno) for a blazing fast front end.
